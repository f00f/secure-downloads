== Specification ==
The plugin ``Secure Downloads'' provides functionality for private downloads.
Only logged-in users are be able to download files. A minimum user level can
be defined on a per-folder basis.

Features:
- The download files are stored in a folder outside of the web-root.
- Each subfolder contains a config file which defines the minimum required WP user level.
- Shortcode to list files of a download folder on a WP page (if allowed)
- Download links begin with the prefix ``SD_DL_BASEURL'' which is redirected to dl.php
- dl.php checks permissions, sends headers, and file content for download
- Shortcode to embed contents of a file in a download folder (if allowed)


== Shortcodes ==
[list_dir dir="<relpath>"]
[show_file file="<relpath>"]
Notes:
- <relpath> is relative to SD_DL_ROOT
- Message, when not logged in: login
- Message, when logged in: insufficient permissions


== Configuration ==

== Permissions File ==
Each downloads folder contains a file with the permissions required to access
the files in it. It defines the minimum WordPress user level.
